;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module is responsible for all direct manipulation of .org
;; files. It uses the built-in `org-element.el` library, which is
;; the canonical way to safely and programmatically interact with
;; Org documents.
;;
;; The core principle is to treat the Org file as a database. We
;; parse it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), perform all
;; modifications on the AST in memory, and then serialize the
;; modified AST back into the buffer. This is safer and more
;; robust than using regex or simple text insertion.
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'org-element)

;;; Core Parsing and Traversal

(defun org-parser/get-ast ()
  "Parse the current buffer and return its Org AST.
The AST is the authoritative representation of the document's
structure."
  (org-element-parse-buffer))

(defun org-parser/find-sync-items (ast)
  "Traverse the AST and find all sync-aware Org headlines.
AST is the parsed Org document tree from `org-parser/get-ast`.

A headline is considered \"sync-aware\" if it has a PROPERTIES
drawer containing a :NOTION_ID: property.

Returns a list of these headline elements."
  (let ((sync-items '()))
    (org-element-map ast 'headline
      (lambda (headline)
        (when (org-element-property :NOTION_ID headline)
          (push headline sync-items)))
      nil t)
    (nreverse sync-items)))

;;; Data Extraction from Org Elements

(defun org-parser/get-headline-properties (headline)
  "Extract all key-value pairs from a headline's PROPERTIES drawer.
HEADLINE is an org-element of type 'headline'.

Returns an alist of (KEY . VALUE) pairs."
  ;; TODO: Implement property extraction from the drawer.
  ;; This involves finding the 'property-drawer' element within the
  ;; headline's contents and mapping over its 'node-property' children.
  '())

(defun org-parser/get-headline-title (headline)
  "Extract the title from a headline element.
HEADLINE is an org-element of type 'headline'."
  ;; TODO: Extract the raw value of the :title property.
  "")

(defun org-parser/get-headline-todo-keyword (headline)
  "Extract the TODO keyword from a headline element.
HEADLINE is an org-element of type 'headline'."
  ;; TODO: Extract the value of the :todo-keyword property.
  "")

;;; Modifying the Org Buffer

(defun org-parser/update-entry (notion-id changes)
  "Update a specific Org entry corresponding to a Notion page.
NOTION-ID is the ID of the page.
CHANGES is an alist describing the modifications, e.g.,
'((:title . \"New Title\") (:todo-keyword . \"DONE\")).

This function will find the correct headline, modify its AST
representation in-place, and then serialize the entire AST
back to the buffer."
  ;; This is a high-level stub. The implementation will be complex.
  ;; 1. Get the full AST via `org-parser/get-ast`.
  ;; 2. Find the specific headline element with the matching NOTION-ID.
  ;; 3. Programmatically modify the properties of that element in the AST.
  ;;    This might involve creating new elements (like a timestamp) or
  ;;    updating existing ones.
  ;; 4. Create a backup of the current file for safety.
  ;; 5. Use `org-element-interpret-data` to write the modified AST
  ;;    back to the buffer, overwriting its contents.
  (message "Simulating update for Notion ID %s with changes: %s" notion-id changes))

(defun org-parser/create-entry (properties)
  "Create a new Org entry from Notion data.
PROPERTIES is an alist of properties from a Notion page object.

This function will construct a new headline element and its
children (like a PROPERTIES drawer) and append it to the AST,
likely at the end of the file or under a specified parent."
  ;; 1. Construct the string for the new Org entry.
  ;;    e.g., \"* TODO [New Task]\n:PROPERTIES:\n:NOTION_ID: ...\n:END:\n\"
  ;; 2. Go to the end of the buffer.
  ;; 3. Insert the new entry string.
  ;; This is a simpler, less ideal approach than full AST manipulation
  ;; for creation, but it's a good starting point.

(defun org-parser/flag-conflict (notion-id reason)
  "Add a :CONFLICT: tag and a note to an Org entry.
NOTION-ID identifies the entry to flag.
REASON is a string explaining the conflict for manual resolution."
  ;; This would be implemented similarly to `org-parser/update-entry`,
  ;; but it would modify the :tags property and insert a text node
  ;; into the headline's section.
